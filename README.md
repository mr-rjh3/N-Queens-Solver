# N-Queens-Solver

## Purpose
Tool that can be used to solve and visualize an N-Queens problem using **CSP Consistency and Minimum Conflict algorithms**.

## Usage
1. Go to the [website link](https://mr-rjh3.github.io/N-Queens-Solver/)
3. Enter your board size and any static queens
4. Click the solve button

### Features
#### Static Queens
  - Any queens that remain on the board when clicking the solve button will force the program to find a solution with the queen in that square.
#### Board Size
  - Enter a board size from 1 - 100 and the board below will update to match.
#### Visualization
  - To help illustrate how the minimum conflicts algorithm works, when the board has found a solution you are able to view each step the board has taken until the solution was found.
#### Randomize
  - You may randomize the postitions of the static queens before you solve the board
